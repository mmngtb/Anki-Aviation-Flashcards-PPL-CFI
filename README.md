## Notes
Anki account and application required before importing cards.
Some of the answers are outdated and aren't atomicized, which is essential for optimal learning. I'm working on updated cards and will release their versions once they are released. Always verify information with your instructor and/or sources.
Some explanations are tailored to me but feel free to change it to fit your understanding.
Tags have hashtags so they are integratable with Obsidian note taking.
