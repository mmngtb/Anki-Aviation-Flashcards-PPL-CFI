# Description
Flashcards for Anki users who are preparing for their pilot's licenses from Private to CFI

If you are new to Anki Flashcards, follow this [guide](https://docs.ankiweb.net/getting-started.html) to get started.

# Notes
Anki account and application required before importing cards.

Some of the answers are outdated and aren't atomicized, which is essential for optimal learning. You'll also notice some duplicate flashcards. I'm working on updating the decks to fix these issues and will announce their versions once they are released. 

Always verify information with your instructor and/or sources if unsure.

Some explanations are tailored to me but feel free to change it to fit your understanding.

Tags have hashtags so they are integratable with Obsidian note taking.
